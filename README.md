# Controlled-Choas

## What is Controlled Chaos; ##

The inspiration for the series “Controlled chaos” was the artistic ordering of randomness.

# Randomness Paradox; 

A system “A” can seemingly produce random values but if the system itself resides in a system “AA” that is ordered, then is to say now which system is truly random?

The inner system “A” is producing randomness but, if that randomness is being calculated by “AA” then the randomness seemly disappears.
The outer system “AA” is calculating the outputs of the random system “A”, which would mean that the calculation themselves are random. Leading to the thought that only randomness can calculate randomness. Having the reversed rolls, reproducing this line of logic would equate to an uncertainty (between randomness and order). 

This uncertainty caught my eye easily. I wanted a way to show this behaviour in real life.

# How these drawings were created;

For the outer system, I made a grid that was mirrored on both the x and y plane. The inner systems “A” was each quadrant of the grid. The system “AA” order comes from the mirroring effect where, 1st quadrant gets reflected onto the 2nd, and then 2nd to 4th quadrant, which then is reflected onto the 3rd quadrant.

For the randomness I decided to go with the randomness of my own though. I would listen to music and paint to the flow or feeling of the song.

Although this method does not accurately test my original hypothesis (no quantitative data), this method produced very cool looking drawings. All these drawing were made in Sketchbook by Autodesk.  

# Where is this leading;

I keep making more of these pieces because the relationship between shape and reflection angle really is beautiful. I hope to one day make a program that is able to generate powerful pictures by using the reflection to make shapes and patterns that have never been seen before.
